In sous vide cooking, you submerge the food <dfn>(usually vacuum-sealed in plastic)</dfn> into a water bath that is precisely set to the target temperature you want the food to be cooked to. In his book, <q>Cooking for Geeks</q>, Jeff Potter describes it as ultra-low-temperature poaching.</p><p>Next month, we will be serving Sous Vide Salmon with Dill Hollandaise. <b>To reserve a seat at the chef table, contact us before <time delatime="2016-08-30"> November 30.</b></time></p><p>blackgoose@example.com<br>555-336-1800</p><p><small><i>Warning: Sous vide cooked salmon is not pasteurized.
